The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling
phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours
which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the
interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants,
common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval
officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two
continents, were deeply interested in the matter.

For some time past vessels had been met by "an enormous thing," a long object,
spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more
rapid in its movements than a whale.
